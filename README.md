# Python-Automatic-picture-folder-cleaner

This program will clean your picture folder. 
It will copy your png and jpg pictures in the new folder and delete old ones. 
You can set how many images you want in your folders. 
You can rename images and it will add a number after the name, starting with 0.



This can help you clean up the image in your folder. At least it has helped me.
